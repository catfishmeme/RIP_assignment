# RIP_assignment
Git for RIP routing assignment 
University assignment where we implimented the RIP routing protocol version 2. The routing demon emulates a router in a given network from a supplied config file. The system only does the build up of links between routers, tear down and updats the topology. Example configs are within this repository and a pituce of the topology is included as well as Topology_Pic.png.
